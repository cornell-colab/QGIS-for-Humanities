### Places to Find Data
[National Historical GIS](https://www.nhgis.org) Contains all U.S. Census data since 1790  
[Cornell University Geospatial Information Repository](https://cugir.library.cornell.edu/) Lots of New York State data, especially physical features.  
[Diva-GIS](http://www.diva-gis.org/gdata)Administrative boundaries and other data for many countries of the world.  
For help finding more data, ask a librarian! (Eliza is at ecb4. If you are in CALS, you might want to try Mann GIS librarian Keith Jenkins, kgj2.)

### Other Things You Might Want to do With QGIS
* Analyze relationships between different data layers.  
* Add an image of a historical map as a layer.  
* Create your own data layer(s). (For example, point locations of study sites.)  
* Create a static map for a publication.  
* Create an interactive web map. (Depending on your situation, [Carto](https://cornell.carto.com/signup) may be a better tool for you.)
